# soundgoodDB

A database developed for the fictional Soundgood Music School during the project sub-course in the
KTH course IV1351 Data Storage Paradigms.

## Project setup

Excluding the exam the course consisted of a project divided over a series of seminars, each with a specific goal
in developing a functional database using the SQL language. We were given a business description of a music school and were given a series of tasks to develop the database to suit this use case.

Initially we created a Conceptual Model (CM) based on the business description using UML or other crow foot notation.

We then built on this, producing a logical/physical-hybrid model of the database. According to this model the script to initialize the database was created.

Next up we were given a series of queries to handle according to simulated business needs. To do this we had to insert data to handle, which in my case was sourced from [https://generatedata.com](https://generatedata.com/).
